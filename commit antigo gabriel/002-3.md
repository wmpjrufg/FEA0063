# Monte Carlo Method

The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that uses random sampling to estimate numerical results.
The central idea of the Monte Carlo method is to randomly generate a large number of samples from a particular process or system, and then use these samples to estimate properties or behaviors of the system as a whole.
The method can be better explained through the following steps:

1. Problem definition: First, it is necessary to have clarity about the problem or property that one wants to estimate.
2. Problem modeling: Next, it is necessary to construct a mathematical model of the problem. This involves defining the variables involved, the relationships between them, and the underlying assumptions.
3. Generation of random samples: The next step is to generate random samples that are representative of the studied system. The samples are generated according to relevant probability distributions, using methods such as pseudo-random numbers or random number sequences.
4. Calculation of estimates: With the random samples at hand, calculations or simulations can be performed based on the mathematical model to estimate the desired property or result. This may involve averaging the sampled values, the proportion of samples that satisfy certain conditions, among other statistical methods.
5. Analysis of results: After calculating the estimates, it is important to analyze the obtained results, including the variability and accuracy of the estimates. Confidence intervals and measures of uncertainty can be calculated to provide information about the reliability of the estimates.

The Monte Carlo method is particularly useful when problems are complex or cannot be easily solved by traditional analytical methods. It allows obtaining numerical approximations for results that are difficult to calculate directly.

<p align = "justify">
The Monte Carlo Method (MMC) is a statistical and computational technique
widely applied in various disciplines, including engineering. Your approach
based on the use of random numbers to estimate numerical solutions to problems
complex, especially those of a probabilistic nature. This approach stands out
for its ability to deal with intricate systems, in which the relationships between
Variables can be complex and analytical solutions can be difficult to obtain.
MMC operates by generating random numbers drawn from distributions
known, which are then used to carry out individual simulations of the problem
in question. Each simulation produces a result that can be interpreted as a
possible scenario, considering the uncertainties and randomness inherent to the system.
One of the main advantages of the method is its ability to incorporate the
uncertainty in analyzes comprehensively. By repeating the simulations a large number
of times, each time with different random numbers, it is possible to obtain a set
varied range of outcomes that reflect the wide range of possible situations. This focus
probabilistic allows you to evaluate not only a single deterministic result, but also
understand the variability inherent to the system.
It is therefore understood that from the analysis of such system variabilities it is
possible to determine and evaluate scenarios in which the requests to which the structure is
subjected are greater than its resistive capacity, thus offering a clear view
comprehensive overview of situations in which the structure may be most vulnerable. This type of analysis
refers to determining the probability of failure \((ùëÉ_ùëì)\).
Determining the probability of failure using the Monte Carlo Method is
associated with the statistical characterization of the parameters used in the limit state function
of model. The limit state function \(G\) is the mathematical representation used to
describe the behavior of the structure according to safety and performance criteria
previously defined for a given condition. In general, this function can be
represented according to Equation <a href="#eq1">(1)</a>.
  
 <table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
 <tr>
   <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[G = R - S\]</td>
   <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq1">(1)</p></td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p align = "justify">
In Equation <a href="#eq1">(1)</a>, \(G(R, S)\) is defined as the limit state function, \(R\) is the
capacity or resistance of the element and \(ùëÜ\) is the stress to which the element is
subject. Its direct interpretation allows identifying which fault domain occurs for
values where \(G(R, S)<0\). On the other hand, when \(G(R, S)>0\) the structure remains
safe, meaning that its resistance is greater than the forces acting on it. Its valid
It should be noted, however, that the occurrence of failure is not always related to collapse
of the structure. In these cases, the occurrence is solely related to non-compliance with
of a given check defined by the failure function, where its values may have
been achieved or exceeded.
  
<p align = "justify">
According to Beck (2019), the probability of failure of an element or system
structure is determined from the integration of a density function of
probability \(\mathbf{ùëì}_ùë•(ùëã)\) over the fault domain \((ùê∫(ùëã) ‚â§ 0)\), as shown in
Equation <a href="#eq1">(2)</a>.  
  
<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[P_f = \left [ G(\mathbf{x})\leqslant0 \right ]=\int_{G(x)\leqslant0}^{} f_{x}(x)dx\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq1">(2)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
 
<p align = "justify">
In this equation, \(G(X)\) corresponds to the limit state equation for the ith mode
of failure. Furthermore, an indicator function \(I[X]\) is used as an auxiliary component
in order to enable the integration of Equation <a href="#eq1">(2)</a> over the entire domain. 


<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[P_f = \int_{\forall X}^{}I\left [ X \right ]dX\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq3">(3)</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[ \mathbf{I} \left[\mathbf{X} \right] = \left\{\begin{array}{l} 1, \: G\left ( X \right )\leq 0 &\\ 0, \: G\left ( X \right ) > 0 \end{array} \right.  \]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq4">(4)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>


Thus, Equation <a href="#eq1">(3)</a> can be rewritten as shown in Equation <a href="#eq1">(5)</a>


<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[P_f=\sum_{i=1}^{N} I\left [ G\left ( X^{i} \leqslant 0\right ) \right ]\cdot \frac{1}{N}\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq1">(5)</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

where \(X^{i}\) represents the i-th sample of the vector of variables \(X\) generated from theprobability density function \(\mathbf{ùëì}_ùë•(ùëã)\). In this way, the determination of \(P_f\) becomes carried out from Equation <a href="#eq1">(6)</a>:

<table border = "0" style = "width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <td align = "left" style = "width: 95%;">\[P_f=\frac{\text{ Number of simulations which } G\left ( X \right )\leq 0 }{N}\]</td>
    <td align = "right" style = "width: 5%;"><p id = "eq1">(6)</p></td>
  </tr>
